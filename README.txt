		How to Edit the Site
  
  INTRODUCTION
  ============
  
  This is a guide on how to edit your site. When you
  edit the site, the changes will not appear on it
  until you reupload the site to the server using an
  FTP manager. If I have not shown you how to do this,
  contact me at fzbreedon@gmail.com, and I will show
  you how to do it, or do it for you.

  IMAGES
  ============
  
  You can edit and change the images on three of the
  site's pages: Painting, Works on Paper, and Archive.
  
  The files for these pages are found in the "images"
  folder. They are named paintings, works on paper, and
  archive. The archive images are divided into
  abstractions and landscapes.
  
  You can add a new image, or move, edit, replace, or
  delete any of the images found in these folders.
  
  ADD  - You can add an image simply by dragging it or
         copying it into the appropriate image folder.
         Keep the file size under 2 MB, or it will
         affect the site's performance.
         
         You must also create an icon for the image you
         added. Open the image in an image editor and
         scale it down to 200 pixels. Name the icon the
         same name as the original image with "icon" at
         the end, and export the new image to the "icons"
         folder in the same folder as the original image.
         Make sure the icon is in the same position as
         it's image.
         
         You must finally also create an information text
         file for the image you added. Create a new text
         document in the appropriate info folder. Name the
         text file the same name as the original image
         with "info" at the end, and make sure it is a
         .txt file. The info file must be in the same
         position as the original image. The format for
         the information is:
         
             Name of the Piece
             Dimensions (height x width in)
             Medium
             Date
  
  MOVE    - The images appear in the gallery on the site in
            the same order as they appear in these folders.
            When you move an image, make sure to move the
            image's icon and information to the same
            position in its folder. Otherwise, the site
            will show the incorrect icon or information for
            the images.
  
  EDIT    - You can edit any image and icon as you like.
            Generally, you don't need to edit an icon to
            match the image if you change the lighting, as
            the icons are too small to see any small changes.
  
  REPLACE -
  
  OTHER
  ============
  
  You can edit and change one other file on the site:
  your CV. The name of the file is "GW_cv.pdf".
  
  You can replace this file with a new CV, as long as
  it is a PDF, and has the same name.
