          <p>Nan’s research is focused on clothing rationing and creativity during WWII.</p>
          <p>She is currently finished a book: <i>Deprivation Fashion</i> about the scarcity of clothing during WWII caused by shortages and rationing.</p>
          <p>Dress Journal of the Costume Society of America has published a chapter from her book:</p>
          <div class="publication-box">
            <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03612112.2018.1551293">Costumes Go to War</a>
            <p>British Propaganda Films Influence Women to Do Their Part</p>
          </div>
          <p>Rationing during WWII inspired creativity including making wedding dresses out of old sheets, repurposing men’s suits for women’s clothing, constructing children’s clothing out of adults clothing, using flour and feed sacks for clothing, bartering clothing for food, shopping second hand markets and knitting and sewing your own clothes out of non-rationed materials.</p>
          <p>More creative ideas inspired by WWII rationing can be found on my <a href="http://deprivationfashion.blogspot.com/">blog</a>.</p>
          <p>A previous chapter was published in Loughborough University’s Duck Journal for Research in Textiles and Textile Design linked <a href="https://www.lboro.ac.uk/microsites/sota/duck/Volume%202_abstracts/Nan%20Final%20Duck%20Paper.pdf">here</a>.</p>
          <p>Nan’s interest in WWII was inspired by researching her father’s experience in the US Army as a Technical Sergeant in the intelligence division of an engineering battalion. She developed a web site for the battalion linked <a href="http://www.1270thengineercombatbattalion.com/">here</a>.</p>
